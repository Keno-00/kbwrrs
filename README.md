# Keyboard warriors
Project for COMMS


"Keyboard Warriors" is a Python program that demonstrates error detection in digital communication through MD5 hashing and checksum validation. It was designed to illustrate error detection in digital communication using modulation and cryptographic techniques.

The program utilizes Python with the Pygame library for creating the graphical user interface. Pygame enables the display of words and interactive elements on the screen.

Error detection is implemented using MD5 hashing, facilitated by Python's built-in hashlib library. This allows the program to compute checksums for words and compare them during gameplay.
